His playmaking has steadily improved since coming into the league and the electric PG looks to run the west for years to come.

However, the defense and body language has become a real problem, as well as issues with how coachable Trae can be. It might be time for a shake-up in the Atlanta roster soon.

With the addition of Mitchell to his Cavs squad, DG has been able to focus more on setting up his teammates and has been very efficient in doing so. Seeing him being able to play next to another star guard is a great sign for things to come.

                This may seem low but injuries have become a real concern for the generational talent. He has yet to prove he can play a full healthy season, and with such a unique body type, it's hard to contextulize the concerns many have. Zion is still a 1 of 1 player, and should he get right this summer, can expect to skyrocket our rankings.

He has proven he can play on and off the ball, and with Dame likely on his way out at some point, Anfernee can expect his role to continue to grow.

He plays winning basketball, and makes winning plays for a winning team. He may not have as big a role as some of the players ahead of him, but he can get buckets at will, and will be crucial for the 76ers title run this year.

                JP is a peculiar case. His creative ball-handling and shot-making abilities are undeniable, but his decision-making and IQ have left a lot to be desired this year. Their seems to be some uneasiness in the Warriors organization with handing the reins off to JP. The talent is indefinetely there, and it's not the easiest situation for a young player to be in, but we need to see more consistent play from JP for him to traject further.

                A shocker to some, we see Claxton for what he is, one of the best young centers in the league. He protects the rim every night, brings intensity, and finishes insanely well (70% fg). Clax is a dynamic big man with lots of room to grow.

                A slightly dissapointing year for the former ROTY. Scottie's taken a small stepback in most areas, and needs to show he can continue to develop going forward.

            The biggest suprise of the year. The two-way player has had an amazing campaign for the young Thunder. He gets after it on defense, and gets to the rim with strong finishes consistently. Shai and him are heading to the play-in and OKC can feel great about their young core.

            The 6'9 Wing is a special 3&D player. He's the kind of player who can fit in with any team in ths league. He's taken a huge leap this year, increasing his drives to the rim. He can shoot, he can defend and he can dunk the basketball. TMIII is one of the best under-the-rader players in the NBA.
